          </button>
          <p class="answer">
            If your account has been hacked, it is important to immediately change your password, enable two-factor authentication, and notify the service provider. You can also scan your computer system for malware and review your account activity for any unauthorized access. To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, it is important to use strong passwords, avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown attachments, and regularly update your software and security settings.

          > How does two-factor authentication (2FA) work, and what are its benefits in enhancing the security of online accounts and systems?
          <img
                    src="images/icon-arrow-down.svg"
                    alt="down arrow"

            />
          </button>
          <p class="answer">
            Two-factor authentication (2FA) works by requiring two forms of identification, such as a password and a verification code sent to your phone, to access an online account. This provides an extra layer of security and helps prevent unauthorized access to your account. The benefits of 2FA include increased security, protection against phishing attacks, and peace of mind knowing that your online accounts are better protected.
