                As a pioneering educational institution in Pakistan, we have taken proactive measures to address the issue of cybersecurity. Our goal is not only to instruct students on how to respond to potential threats but also to equip them with the knowledge and skills to prevent them from happening in the first place. To achieve this, we are exploring several innovative approaches, including the development of educational games, Interactive workshops and seminars , which will foster a more engaging and interactive learning experience. Through our multifaceted initiatives, we strive to create a safer digital environment for our students and to empower them to become responsible digital citizens.
